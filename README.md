Nextjs &amp; tailwind Tutorial

## Next.js

- Install recommended pnpm `npm install -g pnpm`
- To create a Next.js app, open terminal, cd into the folder you'd like to keep your project, and run the following command:`npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm`
- This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the starter example for this course.
